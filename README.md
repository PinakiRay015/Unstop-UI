# Unstop Frontend Assessment

I am Pinaki Sankar Ray, a final-year student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). I developed this frontend web app using <img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/React-icon.svg" height = "25" width = "25"/> (React.js) and <img src = "https://img.icons8.com/color/48/tailwind_css.png" height = "25" width = "25"/> (Tailwind CSS).

## Getting Started with the App

1. Run `npm install` or `npm i` to download the Node modules.
2. Run `npm start` to start the React app.

## Work Done for the Assessment

1. In the main component, I added two sub-components - Side and Main.
   - The Side component contains the sidebar items, which are fixed in position.
   - The Main component includes essential components: Nav, Assessment, and AssmntOverview.
2. The Navbar component contains the navigation items displayed at the top of the screen.
3. The Assessment component displays user stats, scores, or records of assessments.
4. The AssmntOverview component consists of the "Add assessment" button card and a list of added assessment cards. I utilized a mapping function for creating assessment cards.

## Hosting of the Web App

I chose GOOGLE FIREBASE for hosting the app <img src = "https://w7.pngwing.com/pngs/246/288/png-transparent-firebase-hd-logo-thumbnail.png" height = "40" width = "40"/>

## Regards

I approached this assessment by closely following the UI design provided in the Figma file, putting in a lot of effort and passion. The only aspect I couldn't implement was the deactivation of other elements when a side menu or user's stats appear in mobile view. Despite this, the rest of the functionalities work seamlessly. I am committed to improving my skills, and if you consider my work for further processes, I would be grateful.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
